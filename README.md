My programming experience consists of Grade 10 and Grade 11 Computer Science courses. In addition I have also worked on many side projects at home including making a basic personal voice assistant, and working with Raspberry Pi. I have also taken a python bootcamp. I am comfortable with coding in Python, Pascal, Turing, and JavaScript. I have applied to Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering. I intend to study in the computer field. What I love about Computer Programming is that anybody can enter the field very easily. What I like least about Computer Programming is that there are many different languages that do the same task, and different companies have different language requirements for completeing the same tasks.
